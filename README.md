# MHRD Grant Scheme Virtualization

---

This was my 3rd Semester college project to virtualize the calculation and distribution of grants to various colleges as done by **MHRD**. It was a group project.

We collected the data from various public sources and then came up with mathematical formulas to distribute the grant at particular rates. The rates varies depending on many factors. Some of them are research done or ongoing, establishment year, notable breakthoroughs in a particular field, aluminis and so on.

The portal is also meant for new colleges to request for grants and also for colleges to request grants for some new project or research work.

### Running

- To start it, just execute the **main.exe** in windows machine.
